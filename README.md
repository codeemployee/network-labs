## 🔧 Network Automation with Ansible (New!)
I'm currently adding a new section to this repo focused on **network automation using Ansible**.

### ✅ Goals:
- Automate common network tasks like backing up configs and pushing templates.
- Use `ansible.netcommon` and `cisco.ios` collections for device automation.
- Build practical automation playbooks that work with Cisco IOS devices.
